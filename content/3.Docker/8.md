To run as a service, follow the steps

- run `docker-compose up -d` to run the container as a service
- run `docker ps` and see the container running.
```
ubuntu@student-0:~/ops2devops/3.Docker$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE               COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                               NAMES
c5917fd155cc   3docker_webserver   "/docker-entrypoint.â€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 3 seconds   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp, :::80->80/tcp   nginx
```
- Note the name if the container, is `nginx`, and not random generated one.
- open a browser to `http://studentip:80` and see it's still runnning as before.
- Open `index.html` and change `<p>When it's running thru Dockerfile!</p>` to `<p>When it's running thru Docker-Compose!</p>`. 
- Save the file and refresh the website, and see your changes.
- Note the data is not build into the container, but instead directly mounted from the html directory, unlike the `web:v1` and `web:v2` we build earlier.
