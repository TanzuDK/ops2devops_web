- If you don't already have a terminal, in the `3.Docker/1.Task directory`, then right click the directory on the left, and select `Open in integrated terminal`
- This opens a terminal, in the correct directory. Change directory, for each task, either by command, or by doing the above step, each time you progress.
- Run `docker build -t web:v1 .` (Note the . in the end)
- Watch the build finish
- When it's done, you should read `Successfully tagged web:v1`
- This means you build a local container, named web:1
- Run `docker image ls` to see the images local on the machine
- Note you will see both the Web container, and the nginx container, that the web container was build on. As part of this workshop, where will also be a couple of other images, that all start with registry.tanzu.dk, but that is for a later step.
