From folder `3.Docker`

- Open a terminal in `3.Docker` directory (Hint: Right click the folder, and selcect `Open in integrated terminal`)
- Run the command `docker build -t web:v1 .` (Note the . in the end)
- This triggers a build of a container, with the name `web1` and with a version tab of `v1`
- Watch the build as it runs, thru every line of the `Dockerfile`
- When it's done, you should read `Successfully tagged web:v1`


- Run `docker image ls` to see the images local on the machine
- Note you will see both the Web container, and the nginx container, that the web container was build on. As part of this workshop, there will also be a couple of other images, that all start with registry.tanzu.dk, but that is for a later step.
