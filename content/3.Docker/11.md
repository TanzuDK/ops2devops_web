In this task, we are going to look at a more advanced Multi container Wordpress app.

- Run thru the file, and talk about the following :
    - Multiple containers
    - Env variables
    - Links between containers
    - Volumes
    - Depends on
    - restart policy

- Run `docker-compose up` to start the container.
- Look at the images get pulled, and the install process runs.
- Open `http://studentip:80` and run thru the setup guide.
