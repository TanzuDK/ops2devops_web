In this task, we are going to look at a more advanced Multi container Wordpress app.
Note we have multiple docker-comose files, and therefore we need to point to the .wp docker-compose file.

- Open `docker-compose.wp.yml`
- Go thru the file in class, and talk about the following :
    - Multiple containers
    - Env variables
    - Links between containers
    - Volumes
    - Depends on
    - restart policy

- Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.wp.yml up` to start the container.
- Look at the images get pulled, and the install process runs.
- Refresh the browser tab and run thru the setup guide.
- See you new have a full Wordpress site, with seperate Web and DB instances.
- Press `ctrl + c` to stop the container.
