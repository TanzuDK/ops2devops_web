To create and run a container, based on the image you build, in the last step

- Run `docker run -p 80:80 web:v1`
- open a new browsertab to the public ip of your student VM `http://studentip:80` (Hint: Same ip as where your VScode is running)
- See the website that is running :-) (Hint: Keep the tab open, we will use it again)
- Note that when you connect to the website, the logs from the container, is updated in the console. 
- Stop the container pressing `ctrl + c`
