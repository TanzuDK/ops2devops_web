Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

- Open `docker-compose.yml` and examine the content of the file. 
- Note :
    - Internal name
    - Container name
    - Build
    - Ports
    - Volumes (data is external from the container)

- run `docker-compose up` to build and run the container.
- Note we build the container in this example, but we could just as well, pull one from a registry.
- open a browser to `http://studentip:80` and see the website, is updated with a image, and text more fitting for this task.
- Press `ctrl+c`to cancel the running container.
