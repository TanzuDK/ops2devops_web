- All Student ipadresses are shared from a Notion page, found [here](https://robert-jensen.notion.site/Ops2DevOps-c2706b737bb74fe9943367bc2156e7c4).
- Dont copy them, until the teacher has updated with the ipadessed, relevant for the current class. 

You will be given a student number. 
Each student has a public ipadress.
Write it down, since you will you it many times today.

Also write down the public ipadress of the Kubernetes Cluster (Also found on the page)
