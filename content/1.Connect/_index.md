The purpose of this task, is to setup a working conection, to the demo enviroment.

The enviroment consist of multiple ec2 instances, deployed in AWS. 
We connect and use the enviorement, using a versions of [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com)(vscode) called [Code-Server](https://github.com/coder/code-server), which enables us to use vscode, using a webbrowser.

This setup gives us an easy way to see and edit files, while also getting a terminal connectioninside the enviroment.

All steps for this workshop, is described in this website, so it's recommended to use 2 webbrowsers, to easely switch between them.
