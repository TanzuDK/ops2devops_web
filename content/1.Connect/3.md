- In this workshop, we will be using Submenu, Files, Git and extentions.

- Start by opening a folder, that VScode can use as root.
- This is done by selecting `Files -> /home/ubuntu/ path -> ok`

- Note you might see lower right warning, popping up from time to time. It's due to us connecting over http. There is nothing to do about it at the moment, other than just accepting it when it comes.
