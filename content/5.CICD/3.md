- Open github.com and find your repository, and select Actions
- Under `Workflows` your should now see 2 workflows. `4-k8s-1` and `5-k8s-1`.
- The naming represents module and task, of this class. We will only focus on `5-k8s-1` from now on.
- Click on the top `Workflow Run`. The name is the same as your last commit message.
- You should now see your stages. You only have one called `Build` so click on that.
- You can now see all the stages, that we setup in the file. 
- Click on the `Code` tab, and then on `Packages` in the right side.
- Here you can see the 2 container images, you have in your repository. They are now build automaticly, on every push you do.
- !!! If any of your container images has a `private` label next to it, then follow the steps from `4.Kubernetes/1.Task`to make it public.
