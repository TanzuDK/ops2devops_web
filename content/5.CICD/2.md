To activate a actions file, you need to place it in the .github/workflows and push it to github. We will do this now.

- First open the file `ops2devops.yml`, and change the `IMAGE_NAME` variable in the beginning, to your student number, instead of `studentx`

- Save and copy the file, to the root of your github repo, under `.github/workflows` by running this 

```
mkdir -p ../.github/workflows
cp ops2devops.yml ../.github/workflows
``` 
and commit and push your repo after.
