We will now setup automatic building of docker images, and pushing it to your private repo, using GitHub Actions.

- Open `ops2devops.yml`
- Talk about the the file in class.
    - On
    - Env
    - Variables
    - Jobs
    - Packages

To make all the enviroment variables in the file work, we need to add them to Github first.

- Open your repo in github, and select the `Settings` tab.
- Select `Secrets` from the menu, and select `Actions`
- In to top right, select `New repository secret` and create the following 2 secrets.
- `REPO_USER` with the value `admin`
- `REPO_PASS` with the value `VMware1!`

This allows the action to use your username and password, in a more secure way, during run.
