To allow the action to use the Kubeconfig file, we will be saving it in a GitHub secret, that can only be used by the action. Just like we did earlier, with the registry.

- Open your repo in github, and select the `Settings` tab.
- Select `Secrets` from the menu, and select `Actions`
- In to top right, select `New repository secret` and create the following 2 secrets.
- `KUBE_CONFIG` with the entire content from the kubeconfig.yml
