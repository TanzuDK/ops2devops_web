Since the certificate, don't match the external ip of your Kubernetes cluster, it wont work.
To fix this, we will remove the certificate section, and add a Insecure tag into it. 

- To allow connectivity external, without verifying the certificate run
```
sed "s/certificate-authority-data:.*/insecure-skip-tls-verify: true/g" /home/ubuntu/.kube/config > kubeconfig.yml
```
- This created a new file in your `5.CICD` directory named `kubeconfig.yml`

- We also need to change the Kubernetes ip from the local to the external, since GitHub actions are running external in our enviroment.
- Open `kubeconfig.yml` and change the local ip under server to the public ip of the K8S server (Same port and protocol)
