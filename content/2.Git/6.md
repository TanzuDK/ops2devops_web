In this task, clone the newly forked repository, so you can work on it localy on your VM.

- Make sure you are not in the existing folder, vi created earlier, but insted in in the root home folder /home/ubuntu

- Run `cd /home/ubuntu`if you are in doubt in the VScode terminal window.

- Run `git clone CopyedURL`
- Open the new folder in VSCode - Top Menu -> File ->Open folder
- If presented by a security warning, accept that you trust the folder and all subfolders.

- You now have a local copy, of the forked Public git repository for this workshop, and you are running VS code, from that repository, on the remote server.

- To save any changes you do in this repository, you need to commit and push them back to the repo, or else, they will be lost, when this VM get's deleted, after the workshop.


### `Please commit and push, after you finish every step. It's good practice, and it also helps, trigger some of the workflows, needed in later steps, in this workshop.`
