- If you missed it, then you can just open the folder, from the Files menu `/home/Ubuntu/ops2devops`

- You now have a local copy, of the forked Public git repository for this workshop, and you are running VS code, from that repository, on the remote server.

- To save any changes you do in this repository, you need to commit and push them back to the repo, or else, they will be lost, when this VM get's deleted, after the workshop.
