Using the terminal, we will now create the first changes to the Git repository.
For now, we will use the terminal, to learn the basics. LAter we will do the same, using the GUI.

- Create a file with text

    `echo "initial content" > file1.txt`

- Stage changes. Note the `.` means all changes. You could also type the filename you want to add instead. 

    `git add .`

- commit changes, with the commit message "My first change"

    `git commit -m "My first change"`

- make a new change to the file

    `echo "new content" >> file1.txt`
- Note at any time, you can see the content of the file, by typing `cat file1.txt` or by selecting it in the folder view.

- Stage the new changes

    `git add .`

- commit new changes

    `git commit -m "My second change"`

- See the changes you have done

    `git log --graph`

You should now see a log of all the changes you have made, compete with author, timestamp and commit message.
