Using the GUI (VScode) we will now do the same as before. 

- Open the folder you just created `myfirst repo` in vscode `Submeny -> File -> Open Folder -> /home/ubuntu/myfirstrepo/ -> ok`

- Open file1.txt and add or change the content
- Save the file (ctrl + s)

- Notice a number on the Git icon to the left apears. This shows, the number of changes, that has been made, that is not comitted.

- Click on the icon.
- You should see the file you made changes to, in the list.

- See the changes you made to the file (right), compared with the last version (left).
- If you added content, it will apear as green. If you removed content, it will apear as red.

- Stage the file, by clicking the + next to the file.
- It now appears in a section called `Staged Changes`
- Type commit message in the "Message" box in the top and apply it, by typing `Command + Enter` or `ctrl + Enter`
- Do not click `Publish Branch` That is for later.

- To prepare for the next step, select `Submenu -> File -> Close Folder`.
