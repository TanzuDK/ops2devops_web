It's normal to split up Kubernetes configuration files, into more files. To deploy them all, in one command, simply add a `.` in the end, instead of specifiying a single file. We will use this, to deploy both the deployment, and the service, at the same time.

Note, if you have already deployed something, running the command again, just updated the deployment, in case there are changes.


- Run `kubectl apply -f .` to deploy all .yml files in the directory
- You should see each file being created
```
deployment.apps/student1-deployment created
service/nginx-service created
```
- Run `kubectl get all -n studentx` to see your deployment and services has been deployed.
```

- Open a browser to the public ip of the K8S server, with the port number you specified earlier `http://K8SPublicIp:30010` and see your deployment is working, and is exposed to the outside world.
