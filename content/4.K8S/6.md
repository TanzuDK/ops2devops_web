Kubernetes need a place to pull the container images from. In this lab we are using [Harbor](goharbor.io) an open source container registry, started by VMware. 

For our first deployment to work, we first need to build a container, then login and then push the container to that registry.

- Start by building the container by running `docker build -t registry.tanzu.dk/ops2devops/studentx:v1 .` (Change student to your number)
- Then login to the registry by running `docker login registry.tanzu.dk`
- username : ops2devops
- Password : VMware1!
- Then push the container to the registry, by running `docker push registry.tanzu.dk/ops2devops/studentx:v1`

- After this is done, verify the image is now there, by opening a browser to `https://registry.tanzu.dk` and login, using the same username and password as before.

- Click on the folder you just created (Find your student number)
![harbor](/images/harbor.png)

- Here you will find your image. Note the tag you supplied.
- Also note the Vulnerabilities icon. Harbor can security scan every image on push, and setup rules for pulls, depending on the severity.

- For now, just note the name and tag of the image. You will need it in next step.
