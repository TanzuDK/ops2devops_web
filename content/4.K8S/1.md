To access a kubernetes cluster, you first need to have a kubeconfig file.
This files is located in your home directory, in the .kube directory.

On your current machine, there is no kubeconfig file, so in the next few steps, we will copy it, using SCP, from the kubernetes host.

- Run 
```
scp ubuntu@10.0.1.9:/home/ubuntu/.kube/config /home/ubuntu/.kube/config
```
- Type `yes` to Accept certificate
- Password `VMware1!`
```
The authenticity of host '10.0.1.9 (10.0.1.9)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:AFdNTa/DmCCPngOlRK7pjk9cWib8ltiUnfhhf7iHWY0.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '10.0.1.9' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
ubuntu@10.0.1.9's password:

- Look at the config file by running `cat /home/ubuntu/.kube/config` and talk about it's content in class.
