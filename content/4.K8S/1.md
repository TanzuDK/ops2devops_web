To access a kubernetes cluster, you first need to have a kubeconfig file.
This files is located in your home directory, in the .kube directory.

On your current machine, there is no kubeconfig file, so in the next few steps, we will copy it, using SCP, from the kubernetes host.

- Run ```scp ubuntu@10.0.1.9:/home/ubuntu/.kube/config /home/ubuntu/.kube/config```
- Type `yes` to Accept certificate
- Type password `VMware1!`
- Look at the config file by running `cat /home/ubuntu/.kube/config` and talk about it's content in class.
    - Certificate
    - server
    - context
    - users
