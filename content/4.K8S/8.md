- Add a line to `deployment.yml` under `metadata`(remember indentation) with `namespace: studentx`
- Run `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml``
- See the deployment now happens in the namespace you just specified, by running `kubectl get all -n studentx`, without you typing it in each command.
- Delete the deployment again by running `kubectl delete -f deployment.yml`
