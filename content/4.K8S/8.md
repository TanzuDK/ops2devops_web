To skip having to specify the `-n` every time you do a deployment, the namespace can be included in the deployment.
Perform the steps below, to do this.

- Add a line to `deployment.yml` under the top `metadata`(remember indentation) with `namespace: studentx`
- Deploy the app again by running
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml
```

- See the deployment now happens in the namespace you just specified in the yaml file, instead of in the command, by running 
```
kubectl get all -n studentx
```

- Delete the deployment again by running 
```
kubectl delete -f deployment.yml
```
