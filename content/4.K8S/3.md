To verify the connection to the Kubernetes cluster is working, perform the following steps.

- Run `kubectl get nodes` to see you can connect and that the Kubernetes nodes are active
- The result should be something like this :
```
NAME   STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
k8s    Ready    <none>   6d1h   v1.23.4-2+98fc2022f3ad3e
```
- This shows the different nodes of the Kubernetes Cluster, State, Role, Age and version.
- In this workshop, we are working with a single node Kubernetes cluster, but in the real world, there would probably be 3 masters, and a large number of workers. 
- The commands we are using, are the same. We just don't have the same failover capabilities and scale.
