To configure the deployment to work for you, perform the following steps.

- Change all places in `deployment.yml` from `studentx` to your student number.
- Also change the `image` to match the container url from the last step.
- Save the file
- Run 
```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n studentx
```
- This deploys the application in your own namespace
- Verify the application is deployed by running 
```
kubectl get all -n studentx
```

```
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
student0-deployment-7f7b4bc5df-bnlq8   1/1     Running   0          16s
```
- Note we did not expose the app, to the outside work. That is for the next Task.
- Delete the application by running 
```
kubectl delete -f deployment.yml -n studentx
```
