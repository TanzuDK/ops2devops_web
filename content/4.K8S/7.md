To configure the deployment to work for you, perform the following steps.

- Change all places in `deployment.yml` from `studentx` to your student number.
- Also change the `image` to match the container url from the last step.
- Save the file
- Run `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n studentx`
- This deploys the application in your own namespace
- Verify the application is deployed by running `kubectl get all -n studentx`
- Note we did not expose the app, to the outside work. That is for next Task.
- Delete the application by running `kubectl delete -f deployment.yml -n studentx`
