- Change all places in `deployment.yml` from `studentx` to your student number.
- Open your repository in `github.com` and click on `ops2devops/4-k8s-1` under `Packages`in the bottom right.
- !!! If you can't see any packages, then it's probably because you forgot to commit and push your git changes, after each task. Get help from the teacher, or use this url for now `ghcr.io/tanzudk/ops2devops/4-k8s-1:master`
- copy the entire url after `docker pull`
- Replace the url after image, with your own in the `deployment.yml`file
- This is the url for your package in your Github registry.
- Save the file
- Run `kubectl apply -f deployment.yml -n studentx`
- This deploys the application in your own namespace
- Verify the application is deployed by running `kubectl get all -n studentx`
- Note we did not expose the app, to the outside work. That is for next Task.
- Delete the application by running `kubectl delete -f deployment.yml -n studentx`
