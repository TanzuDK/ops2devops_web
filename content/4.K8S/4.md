A Kubernetes cluster, cn be split up logical, to seperate different application etc, by using Namespaces
We will use them, to give each student, their own namespace.
Note there is no security in place, to seperate namespaces. So if you make a typo, you will deploy or delete in another namespace, than your own.


- Run `kubectl create ns studentx` where x is replaced with your student number (See cli if in doubt)
- Run `kubectl get ns` and see that your namespace has been created
- Talk in class, about the concept of a Kubernetes namespace
