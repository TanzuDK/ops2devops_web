A Kubernetes cluster, cn be split up logical, to seperate different application etc, by using Namespaces
We will use them, to give each student, their own namespace.
Note there is no security in place, to seperate namespaces. So if you make a typo, you will deploy or delete in another namespace, than your own.


- To create a Namespace for you, replace x with your student number and run
 ```kubectl create ns studentx``` 

- To see it got created run 
```kubectl get ns```
- Talk in class, about the concept of a Kubernetes namespace
