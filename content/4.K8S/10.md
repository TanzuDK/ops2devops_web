To expose an deployment to the outside world (Lan/Wan etc.) you need to specify a Service.
The file is already created. Perform the steps below, to configure it, to match your deployment.

- Edit the `service.yml` file, so the `Selector: app name`matches the name in the deployment.
- Correct `studentx` to the correct student number.
- Change the nodeport, to match your student number, in the last 2 digits.
  - student0 = 30010
  - student1 = 30011
  - student2 = 30012
  - student3 = 30013
  - student4 = 30014
  - student5 = 30015
  - student6 = 30016
  - student7 = 30017
  - student8 = 30018
  - student9 = 30019
  - student10 = 30020
  - student11 = 30021
  - student12 = 30022
  - student13 = 30023
  - student14 = 30024
  - student15 = 30025
  - student16 = 30026
  - student17 = 30027
  - student18 = 30028
  - student19 = 30029
  - student20 = 30030

- In this demo enviroment, we are using Nodeport, to expose the deployments. Talk about the different ways you can expose a service :
  - NodePort
  - LoadBalancer
  - Ingress
